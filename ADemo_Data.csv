Not much has been done since the tests 6 months ago. No signage on the door. Still have dust buildup around the machinery.

Later I heard the saw making a terrible sound. I told him he couldn’t use the saw anymore.

A  lot of people saw this and did nothing, possibly afraid of retaliation. One person, however, did come forward. 
I put a complaint it to my manager. He gave me a number to contact. A person talked to me and asked me what I wanted to do. I told him I wanted an apology, something done. To the day, nothing has been done.
My witness received retaliation by the Foreman. The Foreman ordered him to do a shitty job all by himself. Everyone in the headquarters knew this was punishment.

While it may come out of their mouths, I can quickly determine if they really mean it or just throwing out another line of bull.
Being the lowest man on the totem pole plus a long-time employee, I'm usually picked for a photo opp during a first-time visit. Safety First means putting on PPE - personal protective equipment. I play along. So on goes the hard hats and the mill tour begins. About half-way in, I then ask: Why aren't you wearing safety shoes like me? The answer I get tells me a lot.
One time we had a lady CFO visit and she was wearing high heels. Boy did she give me a dirty look! Another manager just ignored my question and carried on. The best was a young exec who said: You're right. Let's stop now. I'd like to only go where I don't violate the safety shoes rule. Sadly, he left after a couple of years.

The forklift operator was a strong safety person. Head of the safety committee, 1st Aid attendant – a really safety-conscious guy.
He’s picking up 7 plates 20’ long, 6’ wide. Needs a big forklift and has done this job 30-40 times.
There are welding screens in the shop. As he’s coming into the shop with the forklift, out of the corner of his eye, he sees a guy. He slams on the forklift brakes to stop. His action causes the plates to slide off the forklift.  The back wheels of the forklift are in the air, throwing him off the seat.
I ran over and found him on the ground, non-responsive. I grabbed him partially by one arm to get him out of danger. There were plates scattered all around but luckily none landed on him.
He broke his leg, arm, had a concussion. Later, my brain started thinking  - did I grab him by his broken arm? Did I put myself in danger at the time? You don’t think about these at the time.
He’s back to work now.

I decided to approach him to ask a few questions, not in a interrogating fashion but in a nice way. Boy, did he ever get his back up. He shouted he was totally certified and I should mind my own business. When I replied it was my business, he really got mad, threatened to leave the job site, and would blame me for the loss of productivity. I never felt so humiliated and bullied. I retreated and gave him and his crane a wide berth. I could see the other workers and our foreman also backing away.

You use a safety harness when you work above the pit.
The job called for me to stand on the edge reaching over to work on removing bolts.  If I were to fall, the harness wouldn’t really help me. The lanyard was too long and there was nothing to tie onto to shorten it. I felt I was more in danger wearing a harness.
I took it off the get the work done, a 10 minute job. I later spoke to the safety guy and explained what I had done. He said if you had fallen into the pit, the safety harness would help to lift you out. 
There was no anchor point to connect the harness. Perhaps it needs to re-engineered.

During our tailboard meeting, we talked about doing the lift with the 20T crane. Gate was 1100 pounds but the angle reduced the crane’s ability. One crew said it was passed the crane’s limit. The Foreman said it was safe. There was 2 of us waiting for the gate at the bottom. As we were walking it out on the rails, the gate came down, bounced off the rails, but were able to hang on. Crane outriggers were off the ground – definitely a sign of being overloaded.
The Foreman never reported the incident. A week later, same crane operator had similar situation. Line broke. Nothing was reported.
A month later at a regular safety meeting, I asked if these near-misses had been reported. No, they had not been. Also asked about crane qualifications and who is in charge. I was told that the Foreman who was in charge could determine. I recall the Foreman giving me the evil eye.
Manager did nothing it and I saw no writing about it at all. Manager seemed to be more interested in his own safety record.

Winter came and 2 feet of snow covered the entire yard. At a safety meeting the concern was raised about the broken plank and potential injury. Problem was we couldn't see where it was. Our supervisor said he would look after it. And he did by having a contractor snow plow a huge area. I don't know what the cost was but it certainly was a lot more than simply fixing the broken plank in the summer. All of us shook our heads at how management spends money.
My story has a good ending though. The supervisor also realized how wasteful it was not to fix the plank immediately.
